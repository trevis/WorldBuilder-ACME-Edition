WorldBuilder - ACME Edition

Landscape and world building tool for Asheron's Call. Terrain editing, object placement, texture painting, road drawing, and DAT export.

Originally created by the Chorizite team (https://github.com/Chorizite). This fork is independently maintained by Vanquish.


Whats Working

Terrain
- Raise/lower height, set height, smooth
- Texture brush with shader-based WYSIWYG preview inside the brush circle
- Bucket fill with live texture + scenery preview (constrained to visible landblocks)
- Texture thumbnail palette that swaps in when terrain tools are active
- Road point/line placement and removal
- Slope overlay for seeing unwalkable areas

Objects
- Browse and search the full object catalog from the DATs (setups and gfxobjs)
- Search by hex ID or keyword, filter by buildings/scenery
- Lazy-loaded thumbnail cache that persists across sessions
- Place on terrain with snap, move, rotate, delete
- Multi-select with Ctrl+Click or marquee box select (drag to select)
- Multi-object rotate: select multiple objects and rotate them as a group around their center
- Marquee box select uses full bounding box testing (not just origin points)
- Selection highlight spheres scale proportionally to object size
- Right-click context menu (copy, paste, snap to terrain, delete)
- Copy/paste with Ctrl+C/V, including multi-object paste
- Properties panel with position, rotation, landcell, snap-to-terrain
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Static object height auto-adjustment when terrain changes underneath
- Terrain snap on rotate: objects stay on the ground when rotated on sloped terrain
- Building blueprint system for placing buildings with interior cells
- Building move/rotate correctly updates interior cell VisibleCells references

Layers
- Full layer system with groups, visibility toggles, export toggles
- Each layer tracks its own height/texture/road/scenery changes independently
- Reorder and nest however you want, drag-and-drop
- Base layer always at bottom, cant be deleted or reordered
- Layer compositing for export (top-to-bottom, first non-null wins)

History / Snapshots
- Undo/redo for everything (50 entry limit, configurable)
- History panel lets you jump to any previous state
- Forward entries dimmed, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z
- Named snapshots that persist between sessions

DAT Export
- Exports to client_cell_1.dat, client_portal.dat, client_highres.dat, and client_local_English.dat
- Configurable portal iteration, layer-based export control, overwrite protection

Camera / Navigation
- Perspective and top-down ortho cameras, WASD + mouse look
- Ctrl+G to go to a landblock by hex ID or X,Y coords
- Camera reset button in viewport toolbar
- Position HUD and grid overlay for landblock/cell boundaries
- All overlay toggles: grid, static objects, scenery, unwalkable slopes
- Camera position and mode persisted across sessions

UI / Settings
- UI state persistence (selected tool, panel widths) saved on exit
- File > Exit menu item with graceful shutdown
- Settings saved via MainWindow.Closing and ShutdownRequested
- Splash screen with loading state

Projects
- Point it at your base DAT directory, give it a name, and go
- Recent projects list, everything stored in a local SQLite db

Performance
- Streaming terrain chunks (only nearby chunks loaded, distant ones unloaded)
- Background terrain chunk geometry generation (no frame stalls on load)
- Static object frustum culling (only visible objects rendered)
- Background model loading with two-phase GPU upload
- Texture disk cache for processed RGBA data
- Camera-aware landblock streaming: 2D top-down loads the full visible rectangle, perspective uses proximity
- Zoom-scaled scenery: trees and rocks only generate when zoomed in enough to see them, buildings load everywhere
- Load/unload hysteresis prevents objects from flickering at view edges
- Distance-prioritized loading: closest landblocks load first, distant ones stream in gradually
- Capped batch sizes and max loaded landblocks to keep memory and frame times stable


Controls

WASD or Arrow Keys - move camera
Shift + Arrow Keys - rotate camera (perspective)
Q - toggle between perspective and top-down camera
+/- - zoom in/out
Mouse look for camera rotation, scroll wheel for zoom

Ctrl+G - go to landblock (hex ID or X,Y)
Ctrl+Z - undo
Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y - redo
Ctrl+C - copy selected object(s)
Ctrl+V - paste / enter placement mode
Ctrl+Click - multi-select objects
Delete - delete selected object(s) (with confirmation)
Escape - cancel placement or deselect
Right-click - context menu on selected objects, paste when clipboard has content


Building

Requires .NET 8.0 SDK or later.

dotnet build WorldBuilder.slnx


Running

dotnet run --project WorldBuilder.Desktop

There are also platform-specific projects: WorldBuilder.Windows, WorldBuilder.Mac, WorldBuilder.Linux.


Thanks

Big thanks to everyone who made this possible:
